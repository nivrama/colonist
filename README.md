Write a program that rolls 2 dices 100 times. It should print out the dices separately as well as the combined result for each roll. Each time the player rolls a multiple of three it should print "Ore" and each time the player rolls a multiple of four it should print "Sheep" and for multiples of three and four it should print "OreSheep".
